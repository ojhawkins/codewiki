##### What does it cost to use ETO Margins?
Currently nothing, although it is not free to host the website and run the servers that provide the data. We will endeavour to keep it free but may in the future offer paid pro features. 

##### Is the margin calculation "live"?
The margin calcualtion is as of the close of the previous trading day. This should reflect what your broker charges in the overnight margin. We plan to support live margin estimation in a future release.

##### Can I add more than one portfolio?
The current beta version only allows a single portfolio.


## Examples

We have several examples [on the website](https://reactjs.org/). Here is the first one to get you started:

```jsx
function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloMessage name="Taylor" />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
```
